                            <p>
                                A brief explanation of what S.W.O.T. is:
                            </p>
                        
                            <br>
                            
                            <p>
                                S.W.O.T. is an acronym that stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. S.W.O.T. is often used to help people achieve goals.
                            </p>

                                Strengths are internal factors about you (or business) that could help you achieve goals. This could include personal strengths, or strengths of your company or organization.
                            </p>
                        
                            <p>
                                Weaknesses are internal factors that could prevent you from achieving your goals. This could include personal weaknesses such as lack of motivation or your company/organization weaknesses.
                            </p>
                        
                            <p>
                                Opportunities are external factors that could help you achieve your goals. You might have opportunities for training, increasing your revenue or fast-tracking success.
                            </p>
                        
                            <p>
                                Threats are external factors that you need to look out for in case they prevent you from achieving your goals. Knowing the potential threats will mean you can avoid them or minimize their effects.
