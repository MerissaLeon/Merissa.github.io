                            <p>
                                So far, in college, I have three awards from last year. In Year 9, I got ‘Academic Excellence – Learning Area Excellence – Year 9 Mathematics’ and ‘Academic Excellence – Learning Area Excellence – Year 9 Social Studies’. I got these two awards from prizegiving. The last award was ‘Diligence Award – Year 9 English’. I got this award from whanau assembly. I also did a certificate for Japanese last year. I got it from whanau assembly, and I think it was for getting excellence in all parts or something like that.

                        <h4>Co-curriculars (at school):</h4>
                            <p>
                                I have been in many co-curriculars ever since I was in primary. However, in college as most co-curriculars are after school, I don’t have time to join a lot of co-curriculars as I am busy after school. So, I have only a few co-curriculars last year and this year. In Year 9, I was involved in cross country – eastern zones, NZSS Swimming Champs, Swimming – Individual Champs. In Year 10, I was involved in Junior Maths Competition, Great Kiwi English Competition 2023, orienteering – Macleans College, orienteering – Pakuranga College, and debating so far.
