                            Hi. Ni Hao. Bonjour. Hola. Konnichiwa. Ciao. Anyoung haseyo. Goedendag.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            This website was created for my digital technology (DIT) assessment, but I might as well use it as a good to introduce myself without wasting time. It can save me time, by telling people to just go on this website instead of me spending ages and ages telling them about me. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            My name is Merissa. I am currently 14 years old, and I go to Botany Downs Secondary College. I am in year 10. I was born in Auckland, New Zealand. My parents are both Chinese, which means that I am Chinese too. However, since I was born in New Zealand, I am a New Zealander as well. I have lived in New Zealand my whole life. I have been to a few places, such as places close like Waiheke Island and Wellington to places across the world like China. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p> 
                            In school, I currently take media studies (10MED), digital technology (10DIT), business pathways (10BUP), maths (1MAX), English (10ENG), p.e. (10PEC), health (10HED), science (10SCI), and social studies (10SOS). I always have a positive mindset. I’m not sure what I want to be when I grow up yet. But I hope to live a happy life.
