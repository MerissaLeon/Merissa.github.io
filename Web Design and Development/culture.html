                                    In China, we celebrate Chinese new year, dragon boat day, mid-autumn festival etc.. Chinese New Year is a time to reunite with the whole family and honour our ancestors, worship gods and pray for a bumper harvest year, get rid of the old and make way for the new, participate in all kinds of creativity and have fun. Chinese new year is a holiday, often it is near the end of January. Chinese people get 7 days off work.

                                    During Chinese New Year, people often house clean and decorate their house with the colour red, they have family reunion dinner on Chinese New Year Eve, stay up late, giving red envelopes with best wishes (often the older people give it to the younger people), set off fireworks, enjoy lion and dragon dances, the lantern festival (last day of Chinese New Year). During Chinese New Year, you should not say unlucky words, sweep the floor or take out the garbage on the first day of the New Year, break anything, take any medicine, don’t kill anything (like fish), get a haircut, lending or borrowing anything, washing clothes, hospital visits, crying or fighting as these things will give you bad luck for the rest of the year.

                                    Another thing, that the Chinese are famous for is their dragon dance. But have you ever thought about what the Chinese dragon actually means? Chinese dragons are a symbol of strength, good luck, and power. The dragon statues/figures are everywhere in China. The Chinese dragon has five different colours. The colours of the Chinese dragon are green, white, black, red, and yellow. Each colour has a significant meaning. The dragon in the dragon dance can range in length from 9 meters to 20 meters, with at least ten men to hold the poles that raise and lower the dragon. The dragon dance is usually performed during Chinese New Year, Lantern Festival and Dragon Boat Festival.

                                I am a New Zealander as I am born here. New Zealand’s culture is a mix of Western and Indigenous influences.

                                <p>
                                    The Māori people have lived on the island since the 14th century, and the British colonisers came here in the 18th century, forever changing the course of the history for the inhabitants of New Zealand that were here before them.

                                <p>
                                    Most people who live in New Zealand are either Christian or not religious at all, however our country allows us to include people who believe in different faiths, like Buddhism.

                                <p>
                                    New Zealand is surrounded all by water. We have three main islands, North Island, South Island, and Stewart Island. 
                                </p>
                            
                                <p>
                                    The North Island is the second largest island in New Zealand. The North Island is famous for volcanoes, sub-tropical beaches, big cities, and strong Māori culture. There are many things to do in the North Island.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The South Island is the largest island in New Zealand. The South Island is famous for its natural beauty, and places for winter sports (like skiing, snowboarding etc.). Many people who live in the North Island, come down to the South Island during the Winter season to enjoy the snow. This is because the North Island does not have snow, but the South Island has snow in the Winter.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Stewart Island is the third largest island in New Zealand. Stewart island is one of the best places to see the “glowing skies” or also known as the Southern Lights or Aurora Australis. Steward Island is made up of beaches, wetlands, and native forest, which makes it one of the best places to see native New Zealand wildlife in the wild. There are more kiwis (bird) that live in Stewart Island, then there is of humans. It also has one of New Zealand’s Great Walks (the Rakiura Track).

                                <p>
                                    Rugby is the most popular sport in New Zealand, but many other sports are played in New Zealand as well. Cricket, football, netball, golf, basketball, hockey, tennis, and water sports like sailing and surfing, are quite popular sports in New Zealand as well.

                                <p>
                                    The traditional Māori haka is performed before any rugby match that New Zealand plays in. This is a cultural thing we do here in New Zealand.

                                <p>
                                    The traditional Māori music, dance, and art forms are still practiced today, and have greatly impacted New Zealand’s artistic expression.

                                    A hangi is a special Māori way of cooking food. It is prepared underground, using heated rocks that are buried in a pit oven. The food is then placed on top of the stones. The items are then covered with flax mats or hessian bags for three hours.
                                </p>
